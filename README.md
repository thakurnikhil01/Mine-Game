### Mine Game

**Description:**
A simple "Mine Game" built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, users interact with a grid of clickable cards. The objective is to avoid clicking on red cards. If a red card is clicked, a "Game Over" message is displayed, and all cards are hidden. The game resets, allowing players to start a new round with the same card arrangement.

**Features:**
- **Card Grid Layout:** A 3x3 grid of interactive cards.
- **Game Mechanics:** Clicking a red card triggers a "Game Over" state, hiding all cards.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the game interface.
- **CSS:** Handles the styling for layout, colors, and card appearance.
- **JavaScript:** Manages the game logic for card clicks, displaying the game over message, and hiding cards.

**How to Play:**
1. Click on any card to reveal its color.
2. Avoid red cards to prevent a game over scenario.
3. When a red card is clicked, a "Game Over" message is shown, and all cards are hidden.
